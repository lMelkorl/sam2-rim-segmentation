# SAM2-Powered Semi-Automated Data Generation for Vehicle Rim Segmentation and Custom Model Training

## Abstract

This study demonstrates how foundation segmentation models like SAM2 can be used to create high-quality datasets for training specialized AI models. As a case study, we developed a model that segments only the rim region (excluding tires) in vehicle images. After detecting and cropping vehicle wheels using SAM2, rim masks were generated using classical computer vision algorithms (ROI-based analysis, Hough Circle detection, etc.) on these cropped areas. Manual labeling was performed when automatic methods failed. The custom model trained with these high-accuracy datasets achieved remarkable success on real vehicle images. This approach can be generalized not only for rim segmentation but also for many other specialized AI model development scenarios.

## 1. Introduction

Specialized part segmentation is a critical need, particularly in fields such as virtual try-on, e-commerce, and automotive. However, creating high-accuracy datasets using traditional methods is laborious and costly. The emergence of foundation models like SAM2 has made this process semi-automatic, both accelerating it and improving data quality. This study presents an approach where general models are used as teachers, followed by training specialized student models with high accuracy.

## 2. Related Work

The Segment Anything (SAM/SAM2) models developed by Meta represent significant progress in zero-shot segmentation. SAM2 produces improved mask quality and box-based predictions compared to the original SAM model. Classical methods like Hough Circle were preferred in this study because they perform well on cropped, simple-content images. To date, there has been no direct application of SAM2-supported custom model training in the literature.

## 3. System Architecture and Methodology

### 3.1 Overall System Architecture

Our system consists of three main components:

1. **Automated Data Generation Module** (`gr.py`): SAM2-based wheel detection and multi-mask generation
2. **Web-Based Data Approval Module** (`flask_ui.py`): Manual selection and quality control interface
3. **Model Testing and Evaluation Module** (`web_test_app.py`): Performance testing of trained models

### 3.2 Technical Implementation Details

#### 3.2.1 SAM2 Model Configuration

The system uses Meta AI's SAM2.1 Hiera Large model:

```python
# Model used: sam2.1_hiera_large.pt
# Config: sam2.1_hiera_l.yaml
# Device: Automatic CUDA/MPS/CPU selection
device = (
    torch.device("cuda") if torch.cuda.is_available() else
    torch.device("mps")  if torch.backends.mps.is_available() else
    torch.device("cpu")
)
```

#### 3.2.2 Multi-Masking Algorithm

Three different masking methods are applied in parallel for each detected wheel region:

1. **Coarse SAM2 Mask**: Direct SAM2 output (fast, general-purpose)
2. **Hough Circle Mask**: Perfect circles using OpenCV Hough Circle Transform
3. **ROI-Based Refined Mask**: SAM2 + geometric feature analysis (circularity + area balance)

```python
def save_crops_and_mask_variants(image, boxes, crop_dir, mask_dir, base_name):
    for idx, (x0, y0, x1, y1) in enumerate(boxes):
        crop = image[y0:y1, x0:x1]
        
        # Generate 3 variants
        coarse_mask = generate_coarse_mask(crop)      # Direct SAM2
        hough_mask = generate_hough_mask(crop)        # Hough Circle
        refined_mask = generate_refined_mask(crop)    # ROI-refined
```

### 3.3 Two-Stage Processing Pipeline

#### Stage 1 – Wheel Detection

General segmentation is performed on vehicle images using the SAM2 model. Detected segments are filtered according to the following criteria:

- **Minimum area**: 1500 pixels
- **Circularity ratio**: ≥0.65 (4πA/P²)
- **Aspect ratio**: 0.8-1.2 range
- **Position**: Lower half of the image

```python
def filter_rims(masks, min_area=1500, circ_thresh=0.65):
    for ann in masks:
        area = ann["area"]
        if area < min_area: continue
        
        # Calculate circularity
        peri = cv2.arcLength(cnt, True)
        circ = 4*np.pi*area/(peri*peri+1e-6)
        if circ < circ_thresh: continue
```

#### Stage 2 – Rim Detection (on ROI)

Three different methods are run on each cropped wheel area and the best result is presented to the user:

### 3.4 Web-Based Approval System

Modern Flask-based web interface with:

- **Variant Comparison**: Side-by-side display of three masks
- **Smart Preview**: Mask quality assessment with overlay display
